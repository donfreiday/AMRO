# Distance sampling point counts to predict abundances
Authors: Don and Tim Freiday
Use distance sampling on point count data to predict bird abundances in different ages of tree plantings. Point count data is expected to be in the same format as "PC_DATA_16.csv". Generates a summary csv and graph for each species.
